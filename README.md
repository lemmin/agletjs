#AgletJS

AgletJS works like jQuery where any dom element can be turned into an Aglet. Upon creation, an Aglet automatically has all child elements of interest attached and accessible for manipulation.

A [ThreaditJS](http://threaditjs.com) implementation can be seen at [http://agletjs.com](http://agletjs.com) (open console for benchmarks).

In this demonstration, threads are rendered almost 5 times faster than React.
